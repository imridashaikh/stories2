once upon a time. there was a crow.
he had a piece of meat.a hunfry fox came there.
his mouth watered when he saw the meat .
he thought of a plan to get it.he praised the voice of a crow.
the fox said him to sing a song.
when the crow opened his mouth to sinf,the peice of the meat 
fell down.
the fox ate it and went away

moral: beware of flatter.



one day a fox was very hungry  he searcged everywhere for food
at last the fox went in a vineland he saw some bunches of grapes
hanging from the vines.
he tried to reach rhem but they were to high.
he jumped again and agin but could not reach them .
at last he said these grapes our sour i dont want them and then he ran away

moral: its easy to despise what u cannot have.
